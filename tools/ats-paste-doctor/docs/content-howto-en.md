# Conclusion
If your resume/cover letter formatting breaks when you paste into an ATS or job application form,
you can often reduce issues by cleaning the text before pasting. However, some ATS systems will still override formatting.

# Common symptoms
- Line breaks disappear after paste
- Bullets (• - *) turn into a single line
- Weird spacing from tabs/non-standard spaces
- “Too long / character limit” errors
- Unknown paste errors caused by invisible characters

# How to use (3 steps)
1. Open ATS Paste Doctor and paste your text
2. Choose “ATS-safe” and click “Process”
3. Check warnings and the 2-line preview, then copy the output and paste into the form

# Notes
- Some ATS systems normalize formatting no matter what.
- Avoid pasting sensitive data (browser-only processing, but still your responsibility).
